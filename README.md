## About

The Image Search Engine is a web application that leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to provide users with the ability to search for images. The application utilizes image recognition algorithms and indexing mechanisms to enable efficient image retrieval based on user queries.

## Features

- Image uploading: Users can upload images to the search engine for indexing and future searches.
- Image search: Users can enter a query and retrieve similar images based on their content.
- Image categorization: The search engine automatically categorizes images based on their content using machine learning algorithms.
- Image metadata: The search engine extracts and stores metadata associated with images, such as tags and descriptions.
- User management: The application provides user registration and authentication functionality.
